  This is the report of the the master's degree course 
  Formal Methods for Cyberphisical Systems second assignment. The goal is to implement a symbolic algorithm for the verification of a special class of LTL formulas, using BDDs as data structure to represent and manipulate regions. The class of formulas considered by the algorithm is called "reactivity" properties and have the special form $\square\lozenge f\rightarrow\square\lozenge g$. The report contains description and proof of correctness of the algorithms developed.
